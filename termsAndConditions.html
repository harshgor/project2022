                (“you” or the “User”) agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. We may modify, add, or delete portions of
                these Terms of Use, including the pricing terms, at any time. Any revisions to this Terms of Use will
                become effective the first time you access or use the Service after such changes. If you do not agree to
                abide by these Terms of Use, you are not authorised to use, access or participate in (or continue to
                use, access or participate in) the Service. Also see our Privacy policy.</p>
            <p><strong>System Requirements</strong> : Use of the Services requires one or more compatible devices,
                Internet access (fees may apply), and certain software (fees may apply), and may require obtaining
                updates or upgrades from time to time. Because use of the Services involves hardware, software, and
                Internet access, Your ability to access and use the Services may be affected by the performance of these
                factors. High speed Internet access is recommended. You acknowledge and agree that such system

                “hidden text” utilizing eMeet Marks without eMeet's express written consent.</p>
            <p><strong>Copyright</strong> : You may not post, modify, distribute, or reproduce in any way copyrighted
